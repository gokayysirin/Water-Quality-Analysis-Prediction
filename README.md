# Water Quality Analysis and Prediction

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and predict water quality based on various features in the dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, missing data analysis, data visualization, and model building using machine learning techniques. The project was developed using a dataset from Kaggle.

## What Are We Going to Do?
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing data for analysis by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- **Missing Data Analysis:** Identifying and analyzing missing values to ensure data quality.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizing key features and trends in the dataset to better understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Model Building with sklearn Library:** Implementing machine learning models using the scikit-learn library to predict water quality.
